# Getting started with Pinecone

Most Beginner tutorials start with a hello world program. Don't get me wrong, I would love to, but since I have not yet implemented strings, it would be a mess of nonstandard functions and ASCII codes. Instead, lets start with a program that prints out something far more important.
```
print: 42
```
That's all you need in your file. No includes or boilerplate code of any sort. Just save that as a normal text file with the extension `.pncn` and run it.
